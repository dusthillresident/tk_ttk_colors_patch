# tk_ttk_colors_patch
The code of my patch for Tk enabling consistent app color palettes / colour scheming.

This contains only the files from the Tk source tree that I modified.

I've included 'diff.txt' as a quick reference of the changes that have been made.

The text of my TIP submission is also here in TIP_contribution.txt, and I've included 'ttk_colour_scheme_tester.tcl', a little program I used while testing.
